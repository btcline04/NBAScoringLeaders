# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application - The CLI asks the user for input on multiple occasions and prints out information that the user asks for.
- [x] Pull data from an external source - I scrape data from an HTML table on Land Of Basketball, a basketball website that compiles statistics from NBA seasons. For this project, I've scraped a table that consists of information about the yearly NBA scoring leaders dating all the way back to 1946.
- [x] Implement both list and detail views - When asking for an input from the user for the first time, it gathers a list of 10 years of NBA scoring leaders and displays it in the terminal. When asking for input a second time, the CLI will print out a more detailed view of a specific year in NBA history.
